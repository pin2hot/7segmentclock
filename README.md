# 7segmentclock
Code and design files for a large 7-segment 3D printed clock.

Main 3D design files are by marigu: https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4563300.  Excellent design and easy to print.  I modified a few of the files to expand them a bit to make room for the semi-colons but otherwise files are used as is from marigu.

I used white PLA for the digit segments and gray PLA for the base, connecting pieces and back covers.  White PLA seemed to diffuse the LED strips the best.

Used Adafruit's Perma-Proto Half-size for the case and modified two of the files: https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CAD_Parts/tree/main/1609%20Perma-Proto%20HalfSize
Those files are under 3D Parts.
